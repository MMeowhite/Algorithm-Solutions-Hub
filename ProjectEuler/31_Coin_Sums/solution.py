	Question: In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (Â£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:
	1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, 100p, and 200p
	It is possible to make 200 in the following way:
	1xe1 + 1x50p + 2x20p + 1x5p + 1x2p + 3x1p
	How many different ways can e2 be made using any number of coins?
